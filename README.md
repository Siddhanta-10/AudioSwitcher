## ✨ Features

* **🔇 Smart Mute:** * **Single Press:** Switches the audio device.
    * **Double/Triple Press:** Toggles Mute/Unmute on the *current* device without switching.
* **🎹 Individual Hotkeys:** Assign specific hotkey combinations to any active audio device on your system.
* **🚀 Lightweight:** Runs quietly in the system tray with minimal resource usage (< 2MB RAM).
* **🔄 Auto-Update Check:** Automatically checks GitHub Releases for new versions.

## 📥 Installation

2.  Download the latest `AudioSwitcher.exe`.
3.  Run the executable. The app will appear in your System Tray (near the clock).
